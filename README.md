# Smart Spectacles - Empowering Visually Impaired Mobility

## 📌 Project Description
Smart Spectacles is an assistive wearable device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings safely and independently.  
Using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino UNO microcontroller, the device detects nearby obstacles and alerts the user through a buzzer sound.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **Arduino UNO**
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**
- **Buzzer**
- **Breadboard and Connecting Wires**
- **Battery/Power Source**

---

## 🚀 Working Principle
- The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor sends sound waves forward.
- If the sound waves hit an obstacle, they bounce back and the sensor calculates the distance.
- If an obstacle is detected within a predefined range (e.g., 100 cm), the Arduino triggers a buzzer to alert the user.
- This enables real-time obstacle detection while walking.
